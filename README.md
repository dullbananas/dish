Dish is a new Unix shell implemented in Python with Flask-like configuration and extensibility. It is currently in alpha stage of development. It works by having a Python script called "dish" somewhere in `PATH`. This script looks a bit like a single-file Flask application. Here is an example:

```python3
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from dish import Dish
dish = Dish()

# ansicolor color to be used in PS1 prompt
from dish.ext import ansicolor
dish.register_extension(ansicolor)

dish.config['PS1'] = '<color fg="pink">$</color> '

if __name__ == '__main__':
    dish.run()
```

## Installation

To install the latest stable version:

```console
$ pip3 install --user dish
```

To install the master branch:
